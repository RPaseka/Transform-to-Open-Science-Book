NASA - along with like-minded agencies across the USA government - has announced the Year of Open Science to celebrate the benefits and successes of open science, and inspire more scientists to join the movement. Ultimately, the success of the Year of Open Science will be driven by collaborations with individuals, teams, and organizations who are ready to transform the culture of federal research into one that celebrates openness, and inclusion! The Year of Open Science has set out 4 goals to work towards:
1. Develop a strategic plan for open science
1. Improve the transparency, integrity, and equity of reviews
1. Account for open science activities in evaluations
1. Engage underrepresented communities in the advancement of open science

"The Year of Open Science is a great step forward in promoting productive ways for researchers and scholars to communicate their work more openly and inclusively for the benefit of both science and society," said Dr. Michael Crow, President of Arizona State University and Co-Chair of the Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS). "HELIOS is excited to team with NASA to advance this important initiative."

"We are excited to partner with federal agencies to make open science easier and more rewarding for both individuals and the organizations that support them," said Dr. Geeta Swamy, Duke University Associate Vice President for Research and Vice Dean for Scientific Integrity and Strategic Lead for the Higher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS).  "HELIOS member institutions are eager to develop actionable policies, resources, guidance, metrics, and infrastructure to advance open science scholarship.  Cross-sector coordination through initiatives such as the Year of Open Science are critical to harmonizing and scaling these efforts."

"At TARDIS, we believe that open science is vital for driving innovation and discovery in the field of astronomy. As an open-source Monte Carlo radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code, TARDIS provides powerful and flexible tools for the spectral modeling of supernovae and other astronomical transients. Specifically, TARDIS is used to analyze data from NASA missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The TARDIS community not only provides these tools but also performs research on supernovae, making new discoveries and contributions to the field. In addition, TARDIS has a strong educational mission, training undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other researchers in open-source and open-collaboration techniques. By providing tools and resources for research, training the next generation of scientists, and promoting open science, we aim to support the advancement of our understanding of supernovae and other astronomical transients, and contribute to the broader goals of the Year of Open Science as well as the research efforts of NASA missions."

### For You
Are you just beginning your open science journey? Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog. All of these behaviors exemplify open science and we would like for you to join us in the Year of Open Science! 

If you are excited to learn and encourage others to learn about open science as part of the Year of Open Science, then we invite you to explore how to take [Individual Actions for the Year of Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Open_Science_Journey.html#section-3-open-science-at-work)!

### For Your Team
Is your team interested in adopting open science principles and practices, but unsure of how to begin? The Year of Open Science team activities could help you reflect together on how to equip the people at your organization with practical knowledge in open science, as well as introduce them to a wider community of open science practitioners. 

Learn how to get your team involved in [Team Actions for the Year of Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Teams_Open_Science_Journey.html#section-1-engage-with-open-science)!

### For Your Entire Organization
Is your organization is ready to devote people, funds, and other resources to adopting open science throughout the organization. If your leaders are committed to becoming known as an open science organization, and excited to facilitate open science research through its policy and actions, then we invite you to explore [Organization Actions for the Year of Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Organizations_Open_Science_Journey.html)!
