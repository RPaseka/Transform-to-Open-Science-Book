# Citations and Further Reading

Thank you for attending a Transform to Open Science workshop on the Ethos of Open Science! We are glad to have been able to share the first module of our [Open Science 101 Certification](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/Open-Science-101) with you, and hope to see you in workshops or virtual forums for the remaining modules on open data, open-source software, open results and tools for conducting open science as they become available. 

If you wish to receive an email when the remaining modules become available, please [join our email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform).

This page contains links to all research, case studies, and scenarios posed during the workshop, as well as suggestions for further reading. Resources are grouped by topic, and loosely follow the presentation order of the workshop.
