# Citations and Further Reading

Thank you for attending a Transform to Open Science workshop on the Ethos of Open Science! We are glad to have been able to share the first module of our [Open Science 101 Certification](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/Open-Science-101) with you, and hope to see you in workshops or virtual forums for the remaining modules on open data, open-source software, open results and tools for conducting open science as they become available. 

If you wish to receive an email when the remaining modules become available, please [join our email list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb_6PdbaPYFcVwXWgMJ053Q_pF2rW2YOu51Qmrh5nWaRYc7Q/viewform).

This page contains links to all research, case studies, and scenarios posed during the workshop, as well as suggestions for further reading. Resources are grouped by topic, and loosely follow the presentation order of the workshop.

## Current Open Science Successes and Barriers

To learn more about the **first image of a black hole** you can explore [this video and post](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/ocs/summerseries/19/katie-bouman) by NASA. Most of the images are from the team's Facebook site, and you can find a summary of them [here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/photo-woman-researcher-black-hole_n_5cae82e7e4b0a983fce3e5ad).

To learn more about how open-source is enabling innovation with data from the James Webb Space Telescope, check out these links: "Whether it’s the [core data pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst) that turns raw images into science-ready data, [simulation tools](https://github.com/spacetelescope/webbpsf) to help astronomers understand how to best use the telescope, or the [tools](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz) that astronomers will use to make new discoveries, open source is at the heart of all of [JWST’s] innovation.”
