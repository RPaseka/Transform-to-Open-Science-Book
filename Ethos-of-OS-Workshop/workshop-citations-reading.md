To learn more about how open-source is enabling innovation with data from the James Webb Space Telescope, check out these links: "Whether it’s the [core data pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst) that turns raw images into science-ready data, [simulation tools](https://github.com/spacetelescope/webbpsf) to help astronomers understand how to best use the telescope, or the [tools](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz) that astronomers will use to make new discoveries, open source is at the heart of all of [JWST’s] innovation.”

## What is Open Science? 

The definition of open science used by TOPS is from [open.science.gov](https://open.science.gov/) is:
"Open Science is the principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity." 
Learn more about how NASA defines open science on [our website](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/what-is-open-science/).

Open Science graphcis that TOPS uses in the presentation also include one by [UNESCO](https://www.scientificinfographics.com/21-towards-an-open-science) and the [Digital Skills for Library Staff and Researchers Working Group](10.5281/zenodo.3702400).

To learn about the controversy surrounding "proprietary time" on science missions, we suggest starting with ["Should Webb telescope's data be open to all?"](https://www.science.org/content/article/should-webb-telescope-s-data-be-open-all) by Daniel Clery for Science.org.
