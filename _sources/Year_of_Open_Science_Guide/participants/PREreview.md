PREreviewâ€™s mission is to bring more equity and openness to the scholarly evaluation process, centering the needs and expectations of researchers who have been traditionally excluded from the process. Transformative change needs community coordinated efforts with both bottom-up and top-down input. We support NASA and other funding agencies's commitment to celebrating open and equitable scholarly practices, praising and valuing past and ongoing community-led efforts that have brought us where we are today.
