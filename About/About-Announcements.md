# About NASA Transform to Open Science 

## Announcements!
- TOPS will be at the AMS (American Meteorological Society) Annual Meeting from Jan. 7-12 in Denver, CO! 
- TOPS will also be at the AAS (American Astronomical Society) Meeting from Jan. 8-12 in Seattle, WA!
- TOPS was at the AGU Fall meeting! If you missed us, you can find all our presentations on our [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7444034). If you met us at AGU and are just checking out our repo for the first time - Welcome! We are so excited you are here. 
- NASA's new Science Information Policy has been released! You can find resources, frequently asked questions and the full text of the policy at [science.nasa.gov](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy). At TOPS, we are especially excited about the [Open-Source Science Guidance for researchers funded by NASA's Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SMD%20Open-Source%20Science%20Guidance%20v1%2020221208.pdf)

## What We Do

The world is changing rapidly. Everyday new problems emerge and it takes groundbreaking scientific discoveries to solve them. To stay ahead, the pace of science must accelerate and science needs to be even better, more accurate, and faster to enable the truly transformative breakthroughs that will help us thrive. Closed science, hoarding information and resources, silos of knowledge holds science back by limiting who can participate. We need more voices that work together and share knowledge and resources. Only then will we find new and better solutions. NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission will allow us to create a scientific culture that is ready for 21st century challenges. Open Science will **broaden participation, increase accessibility to knowledge, and embrace new technologies** that can respond to these changes at scale. We hope you will join us in creating an open science infrastructure in your organization. TOPS will show you how! 

## Strategic Objectives

Open Science creates more advanced and inclusive research faster, builds a more just and equitable world, and ensures that minds from all walks of life can participate in science. TOPS is NASA’s ambitious plan to accelerate open science practices. It’s a 5 year journey that will  
1. Accelerate major scientific discoveries 
2. Broaden participation by historically excluded communities 
3. Increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques 

### Learn More About Our Implementation Plan in the Following Areas
- [Engagement](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area1_Engagement/readme.md): Building community, publishing articles, appearing on podcasts, expanding knowledge about open science, integrating Open Science into themes at large-scale events and conferences.
- [Capacity Sharing](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md): Producing online, free, open science curriculum, hosting workshops, events, cohorts, science team meetings, hackathons, and constructing multiple pathways to an Open Science Badge.
- [Incentives](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area3_Incentives/readme.md): Developing Open Science Badge/Certification and establishing high profile awards in support of open science research.
- [Moving Towards Openness](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/readme.md): Recognizing open science practices, holding open meetings, sharing hidden knowledge, and inclusive collaborations.

## TOPS and the Year of Open Science

2023 is the Year Of Open Science, a NASA initiative to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will shift the current paradigm and change practices. *The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) community coordinates efforts designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities.*
